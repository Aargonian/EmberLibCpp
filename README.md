# EmberLib++

---

This project is a simple collection of utilities common to many of my projects. It is not intended for public use at this time, although I don't explicitly forbid it. I make no guarantees about the state of this library at this time.

If anything useful does end up in this library, I will create notes about such things in this README. All code is currently covered under the BSD 2-Clause-Plus-Patent License, as stated in LICENSE.md.
